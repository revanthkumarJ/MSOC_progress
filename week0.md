# 🗓️ Week 0: May 25 – May 31

## 🧩 Overview

Week 0 — the week before the official **Mifos Summer of Code (MSOC) 2025** coding period began — was dedicated to getting a strong technical head start.

During this time, I reviewed the **existing migration status** of the Mifos Android Client. Since the **core modules were already migrated** to Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), I focused on initiating the **migration of feature modules** to Compose Multiplatform (CMP).

## ✅ Tasks Completed

- 🔍 Reviewed existing work and planned out the structure for feature module migration.
- 🧱 Set up the application modules and base structure to support multiplatform development.
- 🧭 Migrated the **Home Drawer** UI to Compose Multiplatform.
- 📦 Migrated the **Activate Module** to Compose Multiplatform.
