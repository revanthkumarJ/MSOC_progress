## üóìÔ∏è Week 5: June 29 ‚Äì July 5

### üß© Overview
This week marked the beginning of the second month of MSOC. I focused on addressing critical bugs, module removal, and significant refactors. I raised and merged multiple PRs targeting client image issues, savings account errors, and further modularization improvements using Compose libraries. In addition, I actively reviewed multiple PRs across **android-client**, **mifos-mobile**, and **mobile-wallet** repositories to support fellow contributors and maintain high code quality.
