# Mifos Summer of Code (MSOC) 2025 - Progress Blog

## üßë‚Äçüíª Introduction

Hi, I‚Äôm **Jilakara Revanth Kumar**, a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering at **RGUKT RK Valley**. I‚Äôm passionate about Android development and excited to contribute to **Mifos Mobile Applications** as part of **Mifos Summer of Code (MSOC) 2025**.

As a part of this summer under **MSOC**, I am focusing on **migrating the Mifos Android Client Field Officer Application to Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and Compose Multiplatform (CMP)**. This migration will help the app become more modern, maintainable, and scalable across platforms, ultimately improving accessibility and performance for field officers and end users.

This blog will serve as a weekly progress tracker of my contributions, learnings, and challenges throughout the program. I hope it inspires and informs future contributors!

## üì± My Project for MSOC

The goal of this project is to **migrate the existing Mifos Android Field Officer application to Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** while enhancing its **architecture, performance, and maintainability**.

This migration aims to make the app run seamlessly across **Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web**, reducing code duplication and improving the developer experience.

Key aspects of this project include:

- üîÅ Replacing the existing RxJava-based network layer with **`fineract-client-kmp-sdk`** using **Kotlin coroutines** and **Flow**.
- üì≤ Introducing **dynamic navigation graphs** based on user roles to support **multiple user types**, not just Field Officers.
- üì° Implementing **offline sync functionality** for uninterrupted access.
- ‚úÖ Increasing **testing coverage** with unit and integration tests.
- üöÄ Enhancing **CI/CD automation** using GitHub Actions and Fastlane for streamlined Play Store releases.

By the end of this project, the Mifos Android Client will be a **modular, scalable, and cross-platform** solution, delivering a better experience for both developers and users.

üëâ _For more details, have a look at my comprehensive proposal submitted as a [GSoC Proposal to Mifos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FNdjwGb5TuSHlhU9c36e7Gx1ERgx3xaPfkTysbKuhw8/edit?usp=sharing)._ 

## üöÄ Pre-MSOC Journey

Before officially beginning my Mifos Summer of Code (MSOC) 2025 journey, I actively contributed to the **Mifos Mobile Applications** for over **7 months**. My focus was primarily on:

- Migrating the existing Mifos Android applications to **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**.
- Fixing **UI/UX bugs** and improving **code structure** across modules.

üìå **Highlights:**
- **19 Pull Requests** successfully merged before MSOC.
- Migrated **7 modules** in the `mifos-mobile` repository.
- Contributed to **2 modules** in the legacy `android-client` project.

I‚Äôm incredibly thankful to the amazing **Mifos community** for their constant support and guidance throughout this journey.

Thanks to Mifos:
- I gained in-depth knowledge of **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**.
- Improved significantly in **Android architecture patterns**, **SOLID principles**, and **clean code practices**.
- Sharpened my **version control** and **collaborative development** skills.

This strong foundation has set me up to confidently take on the challenges of MSOC!
